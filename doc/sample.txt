* _.sample_size(array, n)

  Select 'n' random items from 'array' and collect
  them into a list.

  Example:

    > _.sample_size({1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}, 2)
    { 5, 8 }

* _.sample(array)

  Select a single random element from 'array'

  Example:

    > _.sample({1,2,3,4,5,6})
    4

    The number 4 was chosen for this example
    through fair dice roll, thus it is guaranteed
    to be random.

Since these functions are not deterministic, the
examples may not reflect reality.
