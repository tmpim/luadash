* _.reduce(array, function, zero)

  Reduce all of the elements in 'array' to a single
  value by successively applying 'function' to each
  element, and the accumulator, starting
  from 'zero'.

  Unlike `reduce_with_index', 'function' is *not*
  applied to the indices!

  Example:

    > _.reduce({ 1, 2, 3 }, _.ops.plus, 0)
    6
